Maslow's Basement - Eve Of Destruction

2018 proved every bit as interesting and difficult as the previous year. Having survived cancer and surgery, we now move into the land of incisional hernias, kidney stones, and pain.

I cover a lot of ground on this release, touching upon some of the hottest political topics of the present era, while still somewhat restrained ... there will be more to follow for sure! Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, "Eve Of Destruction".
