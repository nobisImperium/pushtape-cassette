Maslow's Basement is a musical project originally formed in Los Angeles California, now based in Kansas City.<br>
Project music is most often lyrically inspired by several notions related to Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs<br>
and describe the personal journeys and processes involved in escaping from the lower levels 
- (homelessness, drug adiction, etc.)...<br>
... and climbing out of the basement.
