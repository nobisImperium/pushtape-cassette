Maslow's Basement is a musical project originally formed in Los Angeles California, now based in Kansas City. Project music is most often lyrically inspired by several notions related to Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs - and describe the personal journeys and processes involved in escaping from the lower levels (homelessness, drug addiction, etc.) and climbing out of the basement.
